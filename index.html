<h3> <strong>  A short summary Fatima Al- Fihri</strong></h3><p>Fatima Al-Fihri, a muslim woman founded the first known university in the world in the 9th century!</p>
      <p> There is very little biographical information avaliable about her life but we do know some details about how it all started.</p>

<p>Fatima and her family migrated  from Karueein (Qayrawan) present day Tunisia to the city of Fez in Morocco in the early ninth century. Her father was an influential, wealthy merchant in Fez. She and her sister Mariam were both educated in the Islamics Sciences and Fatima had a passion for architecture.</p> 

<p>She was married to an prominent business-man. In short succession, she lost her father, husband and brothers; she and a sister received a substional sum of inheritence assuring their financial independence. Fatima dedicated her wealth to improve and expand her local mosque intending it to service the growing community. Initially, the mosque was used for Islamic education but eventually over the years small colleges were built around the mosque with a wider curriculum of study. Tution and expenses were sponsered by different rulers at the time and it eventually become an interactive bridge into Europe.</p>

<p>I give this tribute to a woman who lived in era where women around the world were supressed from their rights; Fatima Al-Fihri overcame those barriers and distinghused herself.</p>
